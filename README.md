# Hospital-Database-Design-Using-SQL
I designed and normalized a database system to 3NF from the very scratch. The database is responsible for storing patient, doctor, medical record, appointment, and dept information. I Implemented T-SQL statements for the tables, views, stored procedures, functions, and triggers. I also ensured data integrity, security, and backup for the database.
